# 02 Professional Portfolio

# Description 
* This professional portfolio was made from what we had recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. My professional portfolio will contain all the assets I have obtained in HTML and CSS within this course. This webpage will change continuously as the course goes on.

# Implementation
* Media Queries
  * Basic concept of flexbox applied.
* Accessible alt attributes

* Created comments on changed made to index.html and style.css files
